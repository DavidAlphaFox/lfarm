;;; 1am implements a minimal variant of the 5am/eos testing API. Some
;;; reasons for its existence:
;;;
;;; * Compiling tests is ~8x faster than 5am/eos configured with
;;; :compile-at :definition-time.
;;;
;;; * Compiling tests does not cause the default heap size to be
;;; exceeded on some platforms (32-bit SBCL, Allegro Express).
;;;
;;; * Checks may occur inside threads.
;;;
;;; * Test order is randomized on each run.
;;;
;;; * Type inferencing works inside the `is' macro.
;;;
;;; * Tests are runnable as ordinary functions of the same name.
